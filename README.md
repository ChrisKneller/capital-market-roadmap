## Major Market Segments and Types of Instruments

| |Securities Markets|Derivatives Markets|Currency Markets|Insurance Markets|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Primary sectors**|Debt securities, equity securities|Futures/forwards, options, swaps|National currencies, SDRs, Gold|Personal (life, health, property & casualty), commercial (key person, business disruption, property & casualty)|
||||||
|**Economic function**|Channel wealth and real investment|Share risk more optimally|Finance cross border trade and investment|Share risk more optimally|

## Economic Functions of Capital Markets

|What the capital markets allow investors to do|Corresponding reasons for trading|
|:--|:--|
|Allocate savings to investment|New issues of securities|
|Allow flexibility in timing consumption|Liqudity trades|
|Reduce risk through diversification<sup>1</sup>|Portfolio re-balancing, information trades|
|Share risk optimially|Portfolio re-balancing, information trades|

<sup>1</sup> One can invest a small amount into a liquid, diversified product, rather than investing a large amount into one physical, illiquid product (e.g. a house.)

A key point is that any time that a party engages in any type of capital market transaction, both the buyer and seller are altering the risk profile of their portfolio.

> A capital market trade = an alteration of risk in a portfolio

    - Certificates (time)
- Commercial lending
    - General
    - Inventory financing
    - Trade finance

    - Debt
    - Equity
    - Derivatives
- Securities underwriting
- Advisory, structuting and execution of the above

#### Issuance

|Issuers||Investment bank||Investors|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Govt/agency or corporation|Money<br>&larr;<br>&rarr;<br>Securities|Managing underwriter & <br>underwriting syndicate|Money<br>&larr;<br>&rarr;<br>Securities|Individuals & institutions|

The investment bank is out of the picture at this point.

### Other activities in which either may engage

- M&A advisory
- Wealth management
- Asset management
- Prime brokerage for e.g. hedge funds (transaction execution, financing leveraged trades, managing collateral on positions)

## Primary and Secondary Markets

- Primary markets (<10% of transactions)
    - Public offerings
    - Private placements
    
- Secondary markets (>90% of transactions)
    - Exchange (listed) trading
    - Over-the-Counter (OTC) market
    
- Secondary markets are incredibly important for providing liquidity and exit opportunities
- In the absence of secondary markets, how many people would be willing to invest in primary markets, given the incredibly long time frames of returns on investment
- Some argue that the greater the % of secondary market transactions, the more robust the market

## Primary Market Offerings

### Firm commitment underwriting

- Reference to [this](https://github.com/ChrisKneller/capital-market-roadmap#issuance) diagram
- An underwriter will promise an issuer a certain amount of investment, will seek to raise at least that amount from investors and will make up for any shortfall (i.e. they have a firm commitment to raise x)
    
### Yield auctions

- The issuer (govt or large corporation) will set the issue terms
    - Size (how much are they borrowing?)
    - Maturity (3 months, 5 years, 30 years?)
    - Structure (fixed or floating coupon, inflation linked?)
- Competitive bidding - interested parties will bid the highest "price" (yield or interest rate) they are willing to pay by a deadline
- The highest bids will get filled first etc. to a "stop out"
- Orders can be filled at:
    - Bid price (traditional yield auction)
    - Average price (Dutch auction or single price auction)
- The auction process itself determines the effective yield, since none was set initially
- (there can also be non-competitive bids where an investor agrees to take the average price) 
    
### Fixed price / yield offerings

- An underwriter will be part of an underwriting syndicate
- Underwriters take orders from their clients
- Orders are filled based on the relationship between the underwriter and the client
- In Apple's 2013 offering of $17bn, they had over $50bn of bids submitted so clearly not all orders will be filled
- The syndicate members have to decide how to allocate the bonds that they're acquiring as part of their participation - which clients get their orders filled?
- If you have a good relationship i.e. a long relationship of being in good-standing
- It is less certain who will then get their orders filled, compared to yield auctions (where it is essentially just a mathematical comparison)

## Roles of Financial Intermediaries

### Capacity

- Principal - trading for the firm's own account
    - Dealer / market maker
    - Taking opposite side of a trade with a client
    - Firm capital at risk
    - Bid/ask spread
    - Net price to client likely includes a mark-up or mark-down
    - Mark-ups and mark-downs often need not be disclosed
- Agent - executing trades for client accounts
    - Broker
    - Executing a trade on a client's behalf
    - No capital at risk
    - Commission - compensation for time, effort and expense of executing trade - typically must be disclosed
    
### Principal trading
- Market maker / dealer
    - Provide liquidity
        - Bid/ask spread
    - Positioning (inventory)
        - Long or short?
        - Hedge?  
- Proprietary trading
    - Risking firm capital
        - Long/short
        - Leverage
        - Complex strategies
        - Arbitrage

## Comparing Securities to Derivatives

### Securities

- Debt securities (bonds / fixed income)
    - Creditor interest
    - Legal claim (contract)
        - Terms of repayment
        - Interest on debt
    - Senior claim versus equity on liquidation/reorganisation
- Equity securities (common stocks
    - Ownership interest
    - Right of ownership
        - Share in profits (dividends from retained earnings)
    - Input into election of board of directors
    - Corporate actions
    
### Securities vs Derivatives

#### Securities

- Exist primarily to channel wealth into real investment
- A positive or negative sum game (think about how the overall stock market moves up or down)
- No. long positions > no. short positions

|Investors|Stocks/bonds<br>&larr;<br>&rarr;<br>Money|Corp|Expenses<br>&rarr;<br>&larr;<br>Revenues|
|-|-|-|-|

#### Derivatives

- Exist primarily to allow us to share risks more optimally
- A zero sum game
- No. long positions = no. short positions

|Long|&larr;&rarr;|Short|
|-|-|-|

## Introduction to Fixed Income Securities

### Bonds

- A bond is a loan packaged in a certain way to make the ownership easily transferrable
- Bond prices and yields move inversely to each other
- Repayment includes:
    - Interest
        - Payable over time (periodic coupon)
        - Payable at maturity (zero coupon bonds)
    - Principal
        - All at maturity (term bonds/loans)
        - Over time (amortizing bonds/loans, serial or sinking fund bonds)
- Bond valuation - valuing cashflows / complexities
- Uncertainty regarding amount and timing
    - Accelerated repayment (prepayments/calls)
    - Floating coupons (where applicable) and unknown reinvestment rates
    - Failure to pay (delinquencies and defaults)
- What interest rate(s) should be used
    - Pure time value of money (nominal risk free rate)
        - Real risk free rate (yield to maturity of a government security over the appropriate term)
        - Expected inflation
    - Credit spread (nature of the issuer e.g. higher discount rate to value cashflows where there is a greater degree of uncertainty)
    - Liquidity considerations (how easily can we find a buyer for the security we want to sell - if it's difficult, we need a higher interest rate)
    - Embedded options

## Fixed Income Securities: Sources of Return and Types of Risk

### Bond fundamentals - risk

- Default (credit) risk
- Interest rate risk
    - Market (price) risk
    - Reinvestment risk
- Purchasing power (inflation) risk
- Liquidity risk

#### Bond fundamentals - sources of return

- Cash flows
    - Coupon/interest
    - Principal: bond maturities, calls and amortising structures
- Reinvestment income
    - Compound interest or interest on interest income
    - Return cashflows reinvested during holding period
- Price changes
    - Changes in base rates (government/swap rate curve)
    - Changes in issuer sector or credit spreads
    - Embedded options

## Government and Government Agency Securities

### Government

#### Security/sector characteristics

- Usually largest domestic issuer
- Usually the largest and most liquid sector of the domestic market
- Usually simple security structures
    - Short to long term (usually fixed) securities
    - Short term discount securities
- Few/no embedded options (usually not callable)
    
#### Investment characteristics
  
- Risk
    - "Risk-free" securities (this means default-risk)
    - A government can raise revenues easier than a corporate entity through taxation which is legally enforced
    - Governments with their own central bank can "print money" (though this gives rise to inflation risk)
- Expected returns
    - Modest expected returns in a "normal" market
    - Safe haven/flight to safety

### Government Agencies

#### Security/sector characteristics

- Varies significantly between countries
- Usually similar to goverment issues of simple security structures
    - Short to long term coupon (usually fixed) coupons
    - Short term discount securities
- Greater likelihood of embedded options (usually not callable)
- Contract features to ameliorate risk concerns

#### Investment characteristics

- Risk
    - Credit risk issues
        - Source of revenues
        - Government guarantees (explicit or implicit)
    - Other risk considerations
- Expected returns - varies according to risk exposures

## Corporate Securities and Structured Securities

### Corporate fixed income securities

#### Security/sector characteristics

- Wide variety of maturities and structures
- Provisions dealing with credit risk
    - The provisions are written into a trust indenture
    - Priority of claims
    - Secured bonds (assets pledged as collateral)
    - Other protective covenants (e.g. coupon bumped if credit rating downgraded, company prohibited from paying dividends unless they meet certain profitability criteria)
- Embedded options - call, put and conversion

#### Investment characteristics

- Investment grade versus government securities (AA, AAA are similar to govt bonds)
- Returns to taking credit risk
- High yield (less than investment grade) bonds

### Structured securitires

- e.g. mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations

#### Security/sector characteristics

- Asset securitisation - pool of credit instruments or assets (e.g. mortgage-backed securities is a pool of mortgage loans)
- Structured payouts (except pass-through securities) - payouts not done proportionally but returned based on a specified priority of tranches (tranche 1 gets ALL of their payout before tranche 2 gets any etc.)

#### Investment characteristics

- Risk
    - Type/characteristics of underlying loans/assets
    - Credit enhancements/guarantees
    - Safety of senior tranches
    - Liquidity issues
- Expected returns

## Bond Pricing and Valuation

- Pricing and valuation are two different things
    - Pricing - calculating the price implied by the current yield at which the bond is trading
    - Valuation - using analytic techniques to estimate what you think the bond is actually worth

### Pricing formula

- **Face value (F)** or principal value or par value
- **Yield (i)** on a periodic rate basis
- **Exponent** = amount of time until the receipt of the cashflow in compounding periods
- **Period Coupon (C)** = Annual coupon divided by number of compounding periods per year
- **Price or Present Value (PV)**

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=PV%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BC_%7B1%7D%7D%7B(1%2Bi)%5E%7B1%7D%7D%20%2B%20%5Cfrac%7BC_%7B2%7D%7D%7B(1%2Bi)%5E%7B2%7D%7D%20%2B%20...%20%2B%20%5Cfrac%7BC_%7Bn%7D%7D%7B(1%2Bi)%5E%7Bn%7D%7D%20%2B%20%5Cfrac%7BF%7D%7B(1%2Bi)%5E%7Bn%7D%7D">

### Pricing a level coupon bond

- Bond details
    - $1000 par value
    - 7% coupon
    - 5 years to maturity
    - 10% yield to maturity
    - Paid semi-annually
- Where they fit in the calculation
    - F = $1000 
    - C = $35 = $1000 * 7% * 0.5 (0.5 refers to semi-annual payment)
    - i = 5% = 10% (YieldTM) * 0.5 (semi-annual)
    - n = 10 = 5 (YearsTM) * 2 (semi-annual)
    
This is then just calculated as a discounted cashflow to come to the final bond price.

|End of period|Cashflow|PV factor|Discounted cashflow|
|-|-:|-:|-:|
|1|$35|0.9524|$33.33|
|2|$35|0.9070|$31.75|
|...|...|...|...|
|10|$35|0.6139|$21.49|
|10|$1,000|0.6139|$613.90|
||||**$884.17**|

### Bond prices and yields

- Yields, interest rates and rates of return
    - Interpreting interest rates
    - The price of money or the price of credit
- Fixed income pricing/yield conventions
    - Price = PV of future cashflows discounted by YTM
    - YTM = single discount rate equating price to PV of future cash flows
- Yield to maturity reconsidered - yield as price (YTM is a way of expressing the current value of the security)

The key difference between calculating price vs calculating fair value of a bond is that:
- Price uses a constant discount trate
- Fair value varies the discount factor to mirror the fact that risks change over time

### Valuation formula
