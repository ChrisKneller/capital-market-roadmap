## Major Market Segments and Types of Instruments

## Economic Functions of Capital Markets

|What the capital markets allow investors to do|Corresponding reasons for trading|
|:--|:--|
|Allocate savings to investment|New issues of securities|
|Allow flexibility in timing consumption|Liqudity trades|
|Reduce risk through diversification<sup>1</sup>|Portfolio re-balancing, information trades|
|Share risk optimially|Portfolio re-balancing, information trades|

<sup>1</sup> One can invest a small amount into a liquid, diversified product, rather than investing a large amount into one physical, illiquid product (e.g. a house.)

A key point is that any time that a party engages in any type of capital market transaction, both the buyer and seller are altering the risk profile of their portfolio.

> A capital market trade = an alteration of risk in a portfolio
